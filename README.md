# McIntire_Data_Learning_Group @CLOUD_BREAK
This repository was started in efforts to teach UVA Master in Commerce students how to complete projects from our business analytics course in python. The notebooks correspond to the assignments covered in the course with rapid miner. The repository will grow as the class continues. At the end, we will start performing more and more complex projects. 

LNC_Intro_water - The feature notebook of our first meeting introducing python as a technology to solve problems
CB_Load_and_analyze - introduces students to jupyter notebooks. 
CB_DecisionTrees - provides an example of building a simple decision tree, optimizing the hyperparameter of max_depth, and printing statistics on the best model.
